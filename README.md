# Kubernetes Apache Web Application

## Overview

This project demonstrates deploying an Apache web application on an Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) cluster. It includes Kubernetes manifests for deploying an Apache application and exposing it via a LoadBalancer service.

## Project Structure

- `apache-deployment-manifest.yml`: Kubernetes deployment manifest for the Apache application with 5 replicas.
- `apache-service-lb-manifest.yml`: Kubernetes service manifest to expose the Apache application using a LoadBalancer.
- `index.html`: Example HTML file served by the Apache application.
- `indexhtml.yml`: (Deleted) Previous manifest or configuration file related to the project.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create EKS Cluster

To create the EKS cluster, use the following `eksctl` command:

```bash
eksctl create cluster --name playground-cluster --region us-west-2 --nodes 3
2. Deploy Apache Application
Apply Deployment Manifest:

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f apache-deployment-manifest.yml
Apply Service Manifest:

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f apache-service-lb-manifest.yml
3. Verify Deployment
Check Deployments:

bash
Copy code
kubectl get deployments
Check Pods:

bash
Copy code
kubectl get pods
Check Services:

bash
Copy code
kubectl get svc
4. Access the Application
Once the LoadBalancer service is provisioned, you can access the Apache application using the EXTERNAL-IP provided by the service.

Git Operations
